This is a simple app that creates an http server and can route between to urls.

/ and /home are the urls that enable handlers to write a response of "Hello World!"
to the page.

/nextPage is the url that enables a handler to write a random Star Wars quote to the page.


I used an npm module named starwars to genereate the random quote.
