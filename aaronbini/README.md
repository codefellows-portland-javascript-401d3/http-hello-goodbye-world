#A simple http-server

This basic Node http server routes two requests, one to the home page, and one to a goodbye page. If you start the server and visit localhost:8888, you will be automatically directed to the hello page. If you add a '/goodbye' to that url you will visit the goodbye page. Any other routes will re-direct to a 404: Not Found page.
